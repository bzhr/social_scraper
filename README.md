## Stack
Social scraper is a static web page built with modern tools. The stack includes:

- [Gatsby](http://gatsbyjs.org) - Gatsby is an amazing tool for building static web sites using the JAM stack. Static web site can have some dynamism and interactivity by using microservices. This is a very powerful combination. Gatsby web sites are blazing fast which is welcomed.
